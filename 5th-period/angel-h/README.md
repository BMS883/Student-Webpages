# Angel H â€“ Final Portfolio Project

## About Me
Hi, my name is Angel Ho, and this is my final portfolio project! I am currently a junior student going to Mt. Eden Highschool graduating 2026, and I've recently entered the programming world through the APCSP class at Mt. Eden High School.

## About This Project and what i've learned
This portfolio holds mostly everything I've made in this year's class of AP Comp Sci Principles, it is a reflection of all my knowledge. 

Making this portfolio, I refreshed my memory on everything I learned, and even learned a few new skills. I learned how to use GitHub, to use the interface, and to implement my websites and programming into the site. I understand how to make my own website, and I brushed up a little bit on moving files and stuff. It was pretty cool to learn some new things about CSS to decorate my website, like text shadows. I also learned how to combine the different files in coding, like how to put the websites within one another. Utlimately, making the portfolio was confusing, but I pulled through and learned some stuff coming out of it.
